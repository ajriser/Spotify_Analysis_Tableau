# Spotify_Analysis_Tableau
Data analysis and visualization done for Spotify data set on Tableau

## THE PROBLEM STATEMENT
It's a daunting task for the music companies and the artists to go to the market and to identify other artists and subjects with which they should work to be more successful. Their success can be defined as a measure for track being popular and reaching more diversified audiences, resulting in a larger fan base, and creating higher profits.

ADRESSAL OF THE PROBLEM STATEMENT
Musicians all over the world are always looking to collaborate while making music and it’s a very common practice among music companies to create music which has multiple artists. This is a common strategy used by musicians and record labels to grow their audiences and, therefore, their revenue. Spotify data is a great resource for determining the right type of collaborator based on a variety of qualities and characteristics. This project aims to create dashboards that provide insight into the music industry and its general indicators, allowing for more strategic collaboration between artist and music companies and analyze music trends to reach their most preferred audiences.

## SUMMARY OF FINAL INSIGHTS & ANALYSIS AND IMPLICATIONS
In short, the complete analysis focuses on analyzing historical trends in the music industry across various genres and studying different music characteristics and their relationship with popularity. The better popularity will help artists and music companies make better music in the future. 
To reach a bigger audience and promote its unique styles and cultures, the music industry frequently engages in artistic and creative partnerships with one another. This is a typical strategy employed by musicians and record labels to grow their following and thus their revenue. We want to use this as a valuable tool for discovering the right kind of partners based on a range of characteristics and characteristics. This project aims to produce dashboards that give a broad picture of the music industry and its main parameters, allowing artists and music companies to collaborate more strategically.

## LIMITATIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS

Limitations
The dataset and the subsequent analysis have the following limitations:
1.	The dataset doesn’t have user’s demographic data like age and taste of music. 
2.	The dataset also doesn’t have details like how many times a track was liked or played and how it impacts the popularity of a song. 
3.	The dataset can have information like money earned by an artist based on the popularity so monetizing factor can be included in the analysis.

## INSIGHTS

1. Maroon 5 leads with the highest number of albums released at 25, indicating a preference among artists for fewer but more popular tracks over a larger album count.

2. "Falling" by Trevor Daniel is the most popular track with a score of 97, showcasing the correlation between an artist's most popular track and their name.

3. Genre popularity has evolved over the decades, with the visualization suggesting that current music trends could influence artists and companies in choosing genre-based music production.

4. A 400% increase in the number of albums released was observed from 2001-2010 to 2011-2020, highlighting a potential rise in business opportunities for artists and music companies.

5. The 1971-1980 decade saw the highest average track popularity at 48.60 on a 0-100 scale, followed by the 1961-1970 decade at 46.39.

6. Tracks with a popularity rating above 60 typically have negligible instrumentalness and higher values for liveness, danceability, and energy, suggesting these characteristics are crucial for a track's popularity.

7. Danceability is directly proportional to a track's popularity, often nearing a score of one for highly popular songs.

8. There's a notable correlation between instrumentalness, valence, and genre; for instance, rap music tends to have more vocals, while rock music conveys higher positiveness.

9. Rock and pop genres generally exhibit high energy but lower danceability, whereas EDM and Latin genres show a positive correlation between energy and danceability.

10. Interactive dashboards have been created to explore the correlations between artist album count and track popularity, as well as between music characteristics like valence, instrumentalness, energy, danceability, and genre popularity.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
The following are the recommendations for the dataset and the subsequent analysis:
1.	Do some analysis about how duration of a song and the number of times it is played impacts a popularity.
2.	Also, we can try to find a correlation between how may time a track is played vs how many times it was completely played and how it is related to the popularity of the song.
3.	This dataset needs to be combined with official track performance data to understand the full music industry scenario under consideration. In addition, radio performance and other song mentions should also be included in the analysis.
